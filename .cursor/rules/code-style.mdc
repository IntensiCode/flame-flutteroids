development philosophy:

* Short, focused functions.
* Use snake_case for functions, fields and variables.
* Use PascalCase/CamelCase for classes and types.
* Descriptive names preferred over comments.
* Prioritize performance and clarity.
* Iterative refinement of features.

* DON'T ADD STUPID COMMENTS!
* DON'T REPEAT CODE IN COMMENTS!
* DON'T COMMENT IMPORTS!
* DON'T COMMENT OUT CODE!

* DON'T SLAM NEW CODE INTO EXISTING FUNCTIONS!
* CREATE NEW FUNCTIONS AND CALL FROM EXISTING CODE!
* KEEP FUNCTIONS AND FILES SMALL AND TIDY!
